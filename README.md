Objective 
On   completion   of   this   assignment, you   should be able to use   some basic   cryptographic   techniques   to   secure remote communications.
Programing Task Write (Java/C++/Python) UDP programs to allow two parties to perform   authentication   and   establish   a   secure communication   channel. For simplicity, let us   call   the   programs   “Host”   and   “Client”,   which   are executed by Alice and Bob, respectively.Alice and Bob   share   a   common password PW, which   contains   8   alphanumeric   characters.   Alice   also   has   a public   and privacy   key pair   (pk,   sk)   for the   RSA   encryption   scheme.   They   want   to   establish   a   secure   communication   channel   that   can provide   data   confidentiality   and   integrity.   This   will be   done   via   the   following   steps:   (1)   perform   an   authentication   and   key   establishment   protocol   to   establish   a   fresh secret key; and (2) use the established   secret key   to   secure the   real   communication.
Step 1 is done via the following authentication and key   establishment protocol:
1:          B → A: Bob, NB
2:          A → B: Alice, pk, NA
3:          B → A: C1 =   PKE   pk(PW,   K)
Alice   decrypts   C1   using   sk   to   get   PW   and   K,   and   then   verifies   PW.   Alice   sends   either   “Connection   Okay” or “Connection Failed” to Bob to indicate whether the connection   is   successful   or not.
4:         A → B: Connection Okay/FailedIn   the   above   protocol,   NB   and   NA   denote   two 128-bit   random   strings   chosen   by   Bob   and   Alice, respectively, and PKE denotes the RSA encryption. K is   a   128-bit random   secret key   selected by   Bob.   Alice   and   Bob   then   compute   the   shared   secret   key   as   ssk   =   H(K,NB,NA)   where   H   denotes   the      SHA-1 hash algorithm.
After establishing the secret session key, step 2 is   done   as   follows:
1.       whenever Alice wants to   send a message m   to   Bob,   Alice   first   computes   an   integrity   check   value   h = H(ssk, m), and then computes C =   SKEssk(m||h)   and   sends   C to   Bob;
2.       upon   receiving   a   ciphertext   C,   Bob   first   runs the   decryption   algorithm   to   obtain   m||h.   After that,   Bob   computes   h   ’ =   H(ssk,   m)   and   checks   if h   =   h   ’.   If the   equation   holds,   then   Bob   accepts   m;   otherwise, Bob rejects the ciphertext;
3.       the same operations are performed when   Bob sends   a message   to   Alice.
The   SKE in step 2 denotes the   RC4   stream   cipher.
Implementation guidelines 
•          Place Host   and   Client   in   two   separate   directories: Alice   and   Bob.   Alice   also   stores   a   password   file in her directory. The password file contains all the user records,   e.g.,   (Bob,   H(PW)).
•          Generate a public and private key pair   for Alice, and store the generated public and private key      pair in a key file under Alice’s directory. Store the fingerprint of   Alice’spublic key (i.e., H(pk))   in Bob’s directory. This step is done u代 写CSCI368/CSCI968 - (Advanced) Network Security Spring 2024 Assignment 1C/C++

•            Alice executes Host.
-          Host is running   and   listening   to   the   opened   port   (you   need   to    select   a port   (e.g.,   5555)   for   Host).
•          Bob   executes   Client that uses   a   different port number   (e.g.,   3333).
-          Client asks   for   input   (username   and PW)   from   Bob   via   keyboard.
-          Client sends the   first message   in   the   authentication protocol   to   Host.
-          Upon   receiving the second   message from Host, Client checks if   the   received   pk   matches the   stored   fingerprint   of   the   Host.   If   they   don’t   match,   Client   terminates   the    connection;   otherwise, carry   on.
•          Alice and Bob   complete   the   authentication   and   key   establishment protocol.
•          If Alice   cannot   successfully   authenticate   Bob,   then   Alice   sends   “Connection   Failed”   to   Bob   and wait for a new connection. Bob quits the program after receiving   the   message   from   Alice.
•            If   the   connection   is   successfully   established,
-          Either   Alice or Bob can send a   message encrypted and authenticated by the session key ssk.   They   type   the   message   on   their   own   terminal.   The   message   is   processed   by   their   code   according to step 2   given   above.
-          A received message   is printed   on   the   screen    if   decryption   is    successful. Otherwise,   print   “Decryption   Error” on   the   screen.
-          To   close   the   connection,   Bob   should type   “exit”   .
You can choose to use existing libraries or open source code to implement UDP sockets, RSA, RC4 and SHA-1. You should provide a reference if you use any downloaded code. 
How to run? Your   programs   should   run   according   to   the   protocol.   Host   and   Client   should   be   executed   on   two   different   terminals.   For   convenience   of   marking, please use the   local   IP: 127.0.0.1 for the   submitted   version. For simplicity, there is no GUI   required in this assignment. That is, messages are simply typed   on   one   terminal   and   printed   on   the   receiver’sterminal.
